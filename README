Overview:

TitanHide is a driver intended to hide debuggers from certain processes.
The driver hooks various Nt* kernel functions (using inline hooks at the
moment) and modifies the return values of the original functions.
To hide a process, you must pass a simply structure with a ProcessID and
the hiding option(s) to enable to the driver. The internal API is
designed to add hooks with little effort, which means adding features
is really easy.
